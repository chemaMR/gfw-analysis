GFW Analysis

This script is an ArcGIS tool used to calculate annual forest loss area from the Hansen et al Global Forest Change data. Optionally, carbon emissions can be calculated using the WHRC biomass data. The minimum of datasets needed are: Hansen forest loss, 30m area rasters, tree cover density rasters, a shapefile with the area of interest to calculate.
